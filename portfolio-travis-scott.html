						<p>This is a digital painting of Travis Scott. I created this piece of rap art because I like Travis Scott’s music, and I’ve been listening to him since I was in high school, which was when he really became popular. He is someone who I would like to see live in concert, and I have friends who have been to his concerts who’ve each said they had a great time.</p>
						<p>This piece of rap art definitely captures the image of Travis Scott, as he is seen rapping lyrics of his songs into the microphone, supposedly in front of a wide audience. Some positive qualities of this image include the way the natural lines on his fingers are painted, which make them look like actual fingers. The way his face, arms, and dreadlocks are painted looks clean along with how everything such as the highlights, shadows, tints and hues are clearly defined.</p>
						<p>Looking closely, there are a few imperfect areas where the picture may tend to look ragged, such as his watch, necklace, and the lines in his T-shirt which are supposed to indicate the folds in the clothing. Even the white outline of the leaf on his shirt and the white reflection on the microphone are a bit imperfect as well, but they are still striking. </p>
						<p>The reference image used for this digital painting was taken in April of 2017 when Travis Scott was performing at one of his concerts, however the exact location is not known.</p>
