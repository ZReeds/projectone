						<p>This is a sharpie sketch of pop punk band State Champs that I created for the band to give to them at their album release party for their album Living Proof back in June, which I attended. I was very inspired to create this band art piece of State Champs since I love their music, and I wanted to share my art with them</p>
						<p>This piece of band art captures the images of all five members of pop punk band State Champs. Pictured left to right in the photo are guitarist Tony Diaz, bassist Ryan Scott Graham, singer Derek Discanio, guitarist Tyler Szalkowski, and drummer Evan Ambrosio. It took me an hour to create this drawing, yet I was still in such a big hurry to finish it before leaving my house to attend the album release party for their album Living Proof in Downtown LA. Therefore, I had no choice but to leave all their clothes white. What mattered to me the most in the moment while I was creating this were two things - making each band member look like their actual identity and making sure the band would end up liking the finished product, which of course, they did. Even the bassist who I ran into at Warped Tour after State Champs finished their set recognized me from the album release party and said, “Hey Ethan!” after I said hi to him, which made me feel good since I was no longer a stranger to him. I think art can create, strengthen, and maintain relationships with people, especially public figures like the members of State Champs. </p>
						<p>The reference image used for this sharpie sketch was taken some time in the first quarter of 2016, however the exact location is not known nor is it specified.</p>
